/**
 * Problem 439: Ternary Expression Parser
 *
 * Version: Original
 *
 * Constraints:
 *   1. 5 <= expression.length <= 10^4
 *   2. expression consists of single digits (0 through 9), 'T', 'F', '?', and ':'.
 *   3. It is guaranteed that expression is a valid ternary expression.

// TODO: Determine algorithmic paradigm and techniques.
// TODO: Finish complexity analysis.

// NOTE: Premium-only problem (don't bother optimizing).

/**
 * This solution iteratively narrows the head and tail indices of the ternary expression
 * until they converge on the index of the result. Initially, the head and tail are set to
 * the first and last indices of the input. In each iteration, the following steps are
 * performed:
 *
 *   1. Locate the colon in the ternary, which marks the boundary between its true and
 *      false expressions.
 *   2. Evaluate the ternary's condition, with the head pointing to the condition's index.
 *   3. Based on the evaluation, update the head and tail to point to the next nested
 *      ternary expression.
 *
 * The iteration continues until the distance between the head and tail is smaller than
 * the minimum length of a ternary (5 characters). At that point, the head and tail
 * converge, and their indices represent the result of the entire expression.
